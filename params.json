(Install the `.gem` with `gem install confmacs-x.y.z.gem`).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** *Confmacs has currently only been tested on Linux (Arch Linux, to be\r\n  exact) and as such I can not guarantee that it will work on your local setup.\r\n  Make sure to create a GitHub issue if Confmacs isn't working on your local\r\n  setup and I'll look into the problem and attempt to resolve it.*\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nEach separate Emacs configuration is stored under `~/.confmacs/configs` in\r\nits respective subdirectory.\r\n\r\nAn example Confmacs directory tree with three different configurations:\r\n```\r\n~/.confmacs\r\n└── configs\r\n    ├── custom\r\n    │   ├── init.el\r\n    │   └── README.md\r\n    ├── prelude\r\n    │   ├── init.el\r\n    │   └── README.md\r\n    └── spacemacs\r\n        ├── init.el\r\n        └── README.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is possible to list the contents of `~/.confmacs/configs` with the command\r\n`confmacs list`.\r\n\r\nTo select which configuration is active, run the command\r\n`confmacs select <config>`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
